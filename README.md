## Reflection
 

This project's goals were to create a game where a random color is generated and the user has to choose from 3 randomly generated hex colors. If the answer chosen is the corect one, the main color and the 3 answers are generated again, adding to the score of the user. If the chosen answer is wrong, the score is set to 0.
